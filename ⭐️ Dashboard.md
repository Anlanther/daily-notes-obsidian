# ⭐️ Dashboard
This file is to help with navigation across files and to clarify tag and category definitions.

## Tags
Tags are used for `Daily Notes`. They have their corresponding category, which are only used by `Key Notes`.  

The differentiation allows for the segregation in the graph view. By using categories, `Key Notes` also then gets a dedicated page depending on their category.
